![1_Nh39k-nezySp0d20nyYbRA](https://github.com/YogeshSavirigana/Adult_income_census_pred/assets/120144989/e4c56d9d-89ed-4035-9cfd-33659ba6ad07)

# Description:

The "Adult Census Income Prediction" project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether an adult earns more than $50,000 USD per year based on various demographic and socio-economic features. This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset called "Adult Census Income," which is available for reference at the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income%E2%80%9D](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income)

# Dataset Features:

Age: This feature represents the age of individuals and is a continuous variable.

Workclass: It categorizes an individual's work situation, including private employment, self-employment, and government employment.

fnlwgt: This continuous variable represents the final weight, a measure used in the dataset.

Education: Describes the highest level of education an individual has attained, ranging from high school to advanced degrees.

Education-Num: The number of years spent in education, also a continuous variable.

Marital Status: Reflects an individual's marital situation, including married, divorced, single, and more.

Occupation: The type of occupation or job an individual holds.

Relationship: Describes the individual's relationship status within a family, such as wife, husband, or other categories.

Race: Categorizes individuals based on their racial background.

Sex: Specifies the gender of the individual, either male or female.

Capital Gain: A continuous variable representing an individual's financial gains.

Capital Loss: A continuous variable indicating an individual's financial losses.

Hours per Week: Represents the number of hours an individual works per week and is a continuous variable.

Native Country: Indicates the individual's country of origin or residence.

Salary: The target variable, classifying individuals into two categories: those earning more than $50,000 USD per year and those earning less or equal to $50,000 USD per year.

# Project Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict an individual's income level, specifically whether they earn more than $50,000 USD annually or not, based on the provided demographic and socio-economic features. This predictive model can have real-world applications in making financial and employment-related decisions, aiding in social and economic policy analysis, and more.

The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to achieve the best predictive accuracy. The dataset provides a rich set of features, making it an ideal candidate for developing a robust income prediction model. The model's performance will be evaluated using relevant metrics, and the insights gained from the analysis can inform decision-making processes in various domains.

By the end of this project, we aim to have a well-performing predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals likely to have an income exceeding $50,000 USD, thereby contributing to informed decision-making and resource allocation.
